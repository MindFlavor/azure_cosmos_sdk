# azure_cosmos_sdk
Core library for the unofficial Azure Cosmos DB SDK for Rust

## Placeholder

This repo will contain, along with its brothers, the splitted [Azure SDK for Rust](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust). I'm doing this to keep compilation time manageable. 
When the split will be complete I will publish the crates in Cargo and deprecate the original crate. Until then please refer to the original crate (this is a work in progress and, as such, a mess...).

I will try and do some cleanup (removing the oldschoold `try!` macros for example) so the code will not be exactly the same as before. Hopefully it will not break anything.
